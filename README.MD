# Paradise server's official bot

    A bot whose main function is to speak instead of someone who can't speak

    It also has other features like a dummy system of game coins, sending embed messages or play music

    Default prefix = $
    
# Development Status
    I created this bot because not everyone can talk in voice chat but I'm alone in development and between high school final exam, driving license exam and college tests 
    I don't have enough time. This is not my job and not get any salary 
    so at moment the bot will not receive any updates and development status is suspended.

# Start:
    Don't waste time with permissions, the bot is safe:

    https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1004801168674926643&permissions=8&scope=bot

    Doesn't feel trustworthy? here is another link with the minimum permissions needed

    https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1004801168674926643&permissions=412622519376&scope=bot

    type $help to learn all commands
